Symptoms: ineffective emotional regulations, unstable interpersonal relationships, distorted self -\nperceptions, and extreme emotions and behaviors concerning self -harm and suicidal attempts. Why I chose this topic:\nI grew up in a similar family environment as someone with BPD, and one of my family members\nsuffers from related mental health issues. There is a growing awareness of the impact of the\nfamily on one's mental health. Learn about possible family -related causes of BPD in\nwomen for prevention.", "Implicit research question:\nDoes t he incidence of borderline personality disorder\n(BPD) in women relate to family factors during\nchildhood? Thesis idea:\nThe incidence of BPD in women is related to five major\nfamily factors during childhood. Keywords of claims:\na)parental neglect\nb)overprotection (excessive control)\nc)rejection of reasonable demands\nd)inconsistent parenting\ne)childhood maltreatment\nClaim #1\nThe incidence of BPD in women is associated\nwith parental neglect manifested as a lack of care\nfrom parents during childhood. Female participants with BPD recruited in Netherlands and Germany\nreported significantly higher childhood parental neglect than the\ncontrol groups (Krause -Utz et al., 2019, p. 6). According to the research of Merza et al. (2015), in which 85% of\nBPD participants were Hungarian women, 86% of BPD participants\nself-reported a childhood history of physical and emotional neglect\nfrom their caregivers (p. 115). Parental neglect is a general family factor related to the BPD in\nwomen in different contexts but not limited to one specific culture.", "Parental neglect\nBPD participants Other\nClaim #2\nThe occurrence of BPD in women is correlated to\noverprotective parents with excessive control\nduring childhood. According to Fletcher et al. (2014), participants represented by women\nwith BPD were more likely to have caregivers with excessive control\nand protection during childhood, and they could be more negatively\naffected by this parenting style than the participants with bipolar II\ndisorder in the control group (p. 57). Bipolar II disorder: a mental illness similarly characterized as suffering\nfrom severe emotional loss of control\nWomen with BPD reported more environmental influences. Japanese female participants with BPD depicted their parents as\nsignificantly overprotective and overcontrolling in their early years,\nwhich could be more common in Japanese culture, especially for\nwomen ( Machizawa -Summers, 2007, p. 271). Therefore, in East Asian countries influenced by Confucian culture,\nyoung girls are more likely to have parents who are authoritarian\ncaregivers, making them vulnerable to BPD. Women with BPD may have an unempathetic\ncaregiver who rejects their reasonable demands\nduring childhood.", "Claim #3\nFemale BPD patients tended to\nexperience denial from parents\nin childhood, and paternal\nrejection without respect for\ntheir needs was an indicator of\nBPD in the future (Laporte &\nGuttman, 2007, p. 136).Parental rejection with punishment in childhood was\nsignificantly correlated with the incidence of BPD in\nwomen, while the emotional warmth from mothers\nwas a protective factor (Huang et al., 2014, p. 43). These findings reveal the importance that both\nparents accept and respect a girl's understandable\nneeds early in life.Paternal MaternalParental Rejection\nClaim #4\nFemale BPD patients may experience confusing\nand disorganized parenting styles during\nchildhood due to their caregivers' inconsistent\nresponses to similar stimuli in daily life. Parents of BPD daughters tended to have inconsistent values and\ndisciplines toward daily routine, which could increase the risk of BPD\n(Boucher et al., 2017, p. 244). Contradictory messages and behavioral conflicts conveyed from parents\nto their children may be triggers for BPD (Allen et al., 2005, pp. 346 -347).", "Inconsistent guidance can be confusing for adults, let alone\ncontradictory instructions from intimate caregivers when a child cannot\nyet distinguish right from wrong. Claim #5\nChildhood maltreatment from their family is\nalso a high -risk factor for BPD in women. The long -term research indicated\nthat abused children were more\nlikely to be diagnosed with BPD\nby age 40, and there was an\nincreased risk of BPD for girls\nwith sexual or physical abuse in\nchildhood experience ( Widom et\nal., 2009, pp. 441 -443). childhood maltreatment\n↓\nBPD in middle ageChildren with experiences of harsh\ntreatment by caregivers, including\nphysical abuse, were more likely to\ndevelop BPD than children with no\nhistory of abuse (Belsky et al.,\n2012, p. 261). Children are vulnerable to child\nabuse within families, and young\ngirls are especially prone to\nfamily -related maltreatment due to\nthe physiological characteristics of\nfemales. Gender -differentiated BPD incidence\nCounterargumentThere is no clear association between the incidence\nof BPD in women and family -related childhood\nmaltreatment.", "Compared with their sisters without BPD, family -related\nchildhood maltreatment history was not necessarily\nrelated to the development of BPD in women but more\nto personality traits (Laporte et al., 2011, pp. 457 -458). Participants: twin or non -twin sisters who grew up in the\nsame family environment\nIndividual personality traits →BPD in women\nRefutation\nThe previous explanation ignores the significant interaction\nbetween childhood maltreatment and other factors such as\npersonality traits. Instead, there is clear evidence that\nfamily -related abuse during childhood negatively impacts\nthe development of BPD in women. Parental child abuse might increase BPD incidence, and\nchildren with BPD -related temperaments could be more\nvulnerable to the interaction of maltreatment experiences\n(Joyce et al., 2003, pp. 758 -759). According to Martí n -Blanco et al. (2014), most female BPD\nparticipants reported a history of child abuse in their families. Specific temperaments, such as the personality traits that\nindividuals tend to show excessive aggression and hostility to\nblame others, could interact with the history of maltreatment\nto create high -risk factors for BPD (pp. 315 -316).", "The interactions with personal traits put some women in danger even though\nthe effects of childhood maltreatment within families do not exist alone. Conclusion\nParental neglect\n Excessive control\n Parental rejection\nChildhood maltreatment\nStrong correlations\n No meaningful correlations\nConfusing parenting styles\nFinal thoughts\nThe purpose of seeking potential family factors associated with BPD in women is not to blame\nparents or find the source of hatred. Instead, the awareness of the relationship between BPD in\nwomen and family factors in their early life is essential to ease the suffering of female patients and\nhelp them form healthy family relationships in the future .

Each player takes, in their color: 8 plastic figures (6 armies and\n2 scouts); 3 city markers (1 capital and 2 cities); 4 military tech\nmarkers; and a deck of 36 tech cards; also a reference sheet,\na setup card and a deck of 4 government cards each. Place the unit cards on the market board, shuffled into artillery,\ninfantry, mounted, and aircraft decks.", "Each player takes 1\nartillery, 1 infantry, and 1 mounted unit and places them\nfacedown in a single pile as their standing forces. Each player takes their lower ranked military tech markers for\nartillery, infantry, and mounted units, and places them in the\narea below the appropriate unit deck with 1 stripe sides faceup. Then each player takes their aircraft military marker and places\nit below the aircraft unit deck with the star side facedown. Set aside the other military tech markers for now. Sort the building markers by type and place them on their\nspaces. An upgraded building has an arrow next to its name. Build the wonder deck by shuffling the ancient, medieval,\nand modern wonders separately. Place the modern wonders\nfacedown on the top space of the wonder market; then place\nthe medieval wonders facedown on top. Then place the ancient\nwonders faceup in the 4 market spaces below the wonder deck.", "Egypt, if playing, receives one of the ancient wonders at random\nbefore the rest are placed in the market; one of the medieval\nwonders is then drawn and replaces it in the market. Place the matching wonder marker for each of the 4 faceup\nwonder cards in the space next to its card. Separate and shuffle the culture event cards into ancient\n(1 column), medieval (2 columns), and modern (3 columns)\ndecks, and place each deck facedown on its space below the\nculture track at the bottom of the market board. Each player\ntakes the culture level marker showing their leader and places\nit on the start space of the culture track. Place 1 of each market resource token per player near the\nmarket board, returning extras to the box. Each player takes their home map tile and places it faceup in\nfront of them, oriented as indicated in the setup diagram for the\nnumber of players. Return unused home tiles to the box.", "Shuffle\nthe neutral map tiles and deal them out facedown to form the\nrest of the map as indicated. Return unused neutral map tiles\nunseen to the box. Shuffle the great people markers, the hut markers and the\nvillage markers facedown near the market board in separate\npiles. Place the culture, wound, and coin tokens next to the\nmarket board in separate piles. Place the combat bonus cards\nand the Space Flight tech card faceup near the market board\nalong with the disaster markers. Choose a first player and give them the first player marker. Each player places their capital city marker (unwalled side up)\non one of the 4 center squares on their home map tile. The city’s\nsquare is the city center, and the adjacent 8 squares are the\ncity outskirts. Each player takes bonuses as listed on their civilization sheet:\nAmerica gains a random great person, placed in the outskirts\nof their capital at the end of setup. China begins with its capital city marker walled side up.", "Egypt gains a random ancient wonder (already taken from the\nmarket board), placed in the outskirts of the player’s capital. Germany gains 2 extra infantry units from the market board,\nadding the units to their standing forces. Rome begins governed by Republic instead of Despotism. Russia gains the white Russian army figure; when figures are\nplaced on the map, this is also. Russia begins governed by\nCommunism instead of Despotism. Each player takes one of their army figures and one of their\nscout figures and places them (separately or together) in 1 (or 2)\nof their city outskirts squares (not water squares). Each player places their starting tech card faceup in front of\nthem (always in the bottom row of their tech pyramid regardless\nof the card’s level). If another player learns that tech through\nany means, the tech is still considered to be its normal level. Each player stacks their government cards so that the Despotism/\nRepublic card is on top (Despotism side faceup), and places\nthe stack on the civilization sheet space.", "Players starting with\ndifferent governments place the appropriate card faceup on top\nof their cards. Each player counts all of the trade symbols in the 8 squares of\ntheir city outskirts and sets the large outer trade dial on their\ncivilization sheet to that total. Set the small inner economy dial\nto 0 (or more if the player receives coins from a map square or\ngreat person during setup). Each player places 1 city marker, their remaining 5 army figures,\nand their remaining scout figure by their civilization sheet. The\nother city marker is set aside until the player learns the Irrigation\ntech and may add it to these available items. Each game turn is composed of 5 phases performed in the\nfollowing order. 1. START OF TURN\nPass the first player marker to the left (except on the first turn). Starting with the new first player, each player performs any start\nof turn actions, builds any new cities, and changes governments\nif desired.", "Building new cities\nIf you have fewer built cities than your maximum number of cities\n(2 normally, 3 if you have researched the Irrigation tech), you\nmay build 1 or more new cities. You must have a scout figure in each square you wish to place a\ncity marker in. In addition, the square cannot be a water square;\nthere must be 8 revealed squares adjacent to the square; it\ncannot be adjacent to a hut or village token or an enemy figure\n(army or scout); and it must be 3 squares or more away from any\nother city marker (including diagonals). Return the scout to your civilization sheet, then place a city\nmarker on the space, unwalled side up. Only squares in a city’s\noutskirts provide icons and resources. Any friendly figures in the square where a city is built (besides\nthe sacrificed scout) are immediately moved to an adjacent\nsquare that they can legally end their movement in. A city generates trade and production in the same turn it is built.", "Changing governments\nIf you unlock a new form of government during the Research\nPhase, you may change to that government during the Start of\nTurn Phase of the following turn. Place the corresponding card,\nappropriate side faceup, on top of your government deck. If you wish to change to a different government on any turn other\nthan the turn immediately after unlocking that government,\nyou must first change to the Anarchy transitional government. If you are in Anarchy, you may change to any other government\nyou know during the Start of Turn Phase of the next turn after\nentering Anarchy. Any ongoing benefits from a government only last while your\ncivilization continues to be ruled by that government.2. TRADE\nEach player (simultaneously if desired) collects trade; then all\nplayers may negotiate and/or trade. Collecting trade\n Each player increases their trade dial by the total trade\nsymbols in the city outskirts of all their cities. Scouts may gather trade symbols in their squares. A square\noccupied by enemy figures does not produce trade.", "Negotiating and trading\nPlayers may negotiate and/or trade among themselves. Trades\nmay include an exchange of any or all non-binding promises;\npoints of trade; unspent culture tokens; resource tokens from\nthe market or from hut/village tokens; and culture event cards. A player who exceeds their culture hand size as a result of a\ntrade must immediately discard down to their hand size. Items not listed may not be given or traded to another player\nunless specifically allowed by a card or ability. 3. CITY MANAGEMENT\nStarting with the first player, each player takes 1 city action with\neach of their cities. a. Produce a figure, unit, building, or wonder\n The city can produce 1 item with a production cost equal to\nor less than the total production symbols in its outskirts. The entire production cost for an item must come from the city\nproducing it. Excess production cannot be saved. For every 3 points by which you reduce your trade dial, you may\nboost the production of one of your cities by 1 for a single turn.", "You may do this as often as desired. Scouts may gather production symbols in their squares. A square\noccupied by enemy figures does not generate production. Producing figures\nYou may produce an army or scout figure if you have at least\n1 unbuilt figure of that type and can meet its production cost. Take one of the figures from next to your civilization sheet and\nplace it in the outskirts of the city that produced it. Figures may\nnot be placed in a water square unless you have learned a tech\nthat allows your figures to end their movement in water. Figures\nmay be placed in the same square as other friendly figures, but\nthe total figures in a square cannot exceed your stacking limit. Army figures cost 4 each, and are the only figures that can fight\nbattles and explore huts and villages. Scout figures cost 6 each, and may be used to build new cities\nor to gather extra trade, production, or other resources.", "They\ncannot enter squares containing huts or villages and are killed\nimmediately if attacked by an army (unless they have a friendly\narmy escorting them). Producing units\nUnit cards represent an army’s specific units. To produce a unit,\nensure the city can meet its production cost, then draw a unit\ncard at random from the appropriate deck and add it to your\nstanding forces pile. If a unit deck is empty, units of that type are not available until\nsome are killed and returned to the deck. Aircraft units require\nthe Flight tech to be produced. If you reach units that have been returned faceup to the bottom\nof a deck when drawing, turn the deck over and shuffle it. To determine the production cost of a unit, look at the market\nboard to see how advanced the units of that type are:\nArtillery, infantry, or mounted units, cost per unit:\nRank 1: 5; Rank 2: 7; Rank 3: 9; Rank 4: 11.", "Aircraft units always cost 12 each (once unlocked).Producing buildings\nTo produce a building, you must know a tech that unlocks it. Its cost is on the tech that unlocks it and on the market board. Buildings are limited to the available components. Once all of a\ncertain type have been produced, no more can be produced until\none of that type is destroyed. A building must be placed in the outskirts of the city that\nproduced it. Buildings are restricted to certain types of terrain, as noted on\nthe market board. Any number of a given type of building may\nbe built in a city as long as suitable terrain exists. Building names separated by a slash are the basic and upgraded\nforms of the same building type, on the front and back of the\nsame marker. Once a building marker is placed on a square, its icons replace\nany on the square. A water square with a Harbor placed in it is\nstill considered to be water for the purposes of movement.", "Limited buildings (star) are restricted to 1 per city. City walls may be built using the Masonry tech and are treated\nlike any other building, except they are considered to be in the\ncity’s center. Flip the city marker to its walled side. Only 1 City\nWalls may be built per city. Producing wonders\nTo produce one of the wonders faceup in the market, pay the\nproduction cost on its wonder card (or the discounted cost if you\nknow the specific tech listed). The entire cost  must be paid by a single city. Place the wonder card faceup in front of you and the wonder\ntoken in the outskirts of the relevant city. Then draw a new\nwonder from the wonder deck and add it to the market, with its\ncorresponding wonder marker next to the card. Wonders may be placed on any terrain except for water and are\nrestricted to 1 per city. A city may contain both a wonder and 1\nlimited building. Abilities affecting buildings do not affect wonders unless explicitly\nstated.", "Certain tech cards allow a player to obsolete a wonder, negating\nits special ability for the rest of the game. Replacing buildings and wonders\nYou may replace one of your existing buildings or wonders\nwhen placing a new building or wonder (a wonder may replace\na building and vice versa). The new building or wonder must be\nable to be legally placed once the old one is removed. You may\nnot replace another player’s building or wonder. Old buildings are returned to the market. Old wonders and their\ncards may not be rebuilt for the rest of the game. b. Devote to the arts\n Take 1 culture token from the stockpile, plus\n1 additional token per culture icon that appears\nin the outskirts of the city. Scouts may gather culture symbols in their squares. A square\noccupied by enemy figures does not produce culture. Spending culture\nAny time during your City Management Phase, you may choose\nto spend some or all of your culture tokens to advance your\nculture level marker up the culture track on the market board.", "Pay the cost listed on the space your marker is entering, move\nyour marker, then claim the reward shown on the space. Higher up, advancing on the track costs trade as well as culture. Both costs must be paid in full for each space advanced (trade\nis spent from your trade dial). You may advance as many spaces up the culture track each turn\nas you can afford. Multiple markers may occupy the same space. The 3 different types of spaces are:\nCulture event: Draw a culture event card from the culture event\ndeck pictured on the space and secretly add it to your hand. If you exceed your culture hand size, immediately discard down\nto your hand size before any culture event cards can be played. Great people: Draw a great person marker at random from the\nfacedown pile. You may then either immediately place the great\nperson in a city or hold it in reserve. Culture victory: You immediately win the game (culture victory). Culture event cards\nCulture event cards are kept secret in a player’s hand.", "Your\nmaximum hand size starts at 2, but may be increased by tech. They may only be played during the phase indicated on the card. Read the title and the effect and then perform the effect before\ndiscarding the card. Discarded culture event cards are placed faceup at the bottom\nof the appropriate deck. If you reach a card that is faceup, turn\nthe deck over and shuffle it to create a new culture event deck. Great people\nA new great people marker may be immediately placed in the\noutskirts of one of your cities, on any terrain except water. They\nreplace any building or wonder they are placed on. A great person marker that is replaced (by having a building,\nwonder, or another great person placed in their square), is held\nin reserve and returned to your civilization sheet instead of being\ndiscarded (they have no effect when not on the map). During the Start of Turn Phase of any turn, you may place any\ngreat people on your civilization sheet back on the map as above. c.", "Harvest a resource\nTo take this action, the city must have a square with that\nresource’s icon in its outskirts. Take 1 resource token of that type from the market board and\nplace it on your civilization sheet. You cannot harvest a resource\nif the market is out of that resource, and a city may only harvest\n1 resource per action. Resources power resource abilities on tech cards. Each time\nyou want to use a resource ability, pay its cost by spending the\nappropriate resource(s). Scouts may harvest resources in their squares. A square\noccupied by enemy figures cannot be harvested. 4. MOVEMENT\nStarting with the first player, each player moves any or all of their\nfigures (armies and scouts), one at a time, up to a number of\nsquares equal to their civilization’s travel speed. A civilization’s travel speed starts at 2, but may be increased by\nlearning tech such as Horseback Riding. Figures cannot move\ndiagonally. A figure that has begun its move must complete it\nbefore any other figure may move.", "You may move several figures as a group if they all begin this\nphase in the same square. You may never have more figures in\na single square than your stacking limit. The stacking limit starts\nat 2, but may be increased by learning tech such as Masonry. At the start of the game, figures cannot enter water squares,\nbut acquiring certain tech can allow your figures to do so. The\nNavigation tech allows a player’s figures to cross water but not\nmake any movement that would result in ending their movement\nin a water square. Certain tech cards, such as Sailing, allow your figures to both\nmove through and end their movement on water squares. Unexplored map tiles\nA facedown map tile cannot be moved onto or crossed for any\nreason, nor can the effects of any tech or culture event card\ncross or affect any of its squares.You may discover (turn faceup) a facedown map tile by spending\n1 square of movement when one of your figures is orthogonally\nadjacent to the tile.", "Orient the tile so that the arrow points away\nfrom the tile that the figure is on. Draw 1 random hut marker place it facedown, without looking at\nit, on each square with a hut icon on the map tile. Draw 1 random\nvillage marker and place it facedown, without looking at it, on\neach square with a village icon. Exploring huts and villages\nScout figures cannot enter a square with a hut or village marker. An army figure that enters a square with a hut or village marker\nimmediately ends its movement and explores the hut or village. If the marker is a hut, look at it, then place it facedown on your\ncivilization sheet. The resources on the back of hut markers may\nbe spent like resource tokens taken from the market, but they are\nreturned to the box after being spent.", "If the marker is a village,the player to the left of the invading\nplayer becomes the barbarian player and draws 1 artillery,\n1 infantry, and 1 mounted unit from the respective decks (if\none or more of the decks are depleted, make up the difference\nfrom one of the other decks, as chosen by the barbarian player). These units are barbarians and are kept separate from the\nbarbarian player’s own units. A battle then takes place between\nthe barbarian player’s barbarian units (the defender) and the\ninvading player. Barbarian units are always rank 1. If the invading player wins, they look at the village marker. If it shows a great person icon, they discards the village marker\nand then gains a random great person. Otherwise, the village\nmarker shows a resource and is placed facedown on the player’s\ncivilization sheet, where it acts like a hut marker. If the invading player loses, the army figure that entered the\nsquare (or the entire group of figures) is killed and is returned\nto the player’s civilization sheet.", "Enemy figures\nScouts cannot enter a square with enemy figures. An army that\nenters a square with enemy figures immediately ends its move. If the square contains only enemy scouts, the scouts are\nimmediately killed and the attacking player collects loot as\nthough they had won a battle. If the square contains at least 1\nenemy army, a battle occurs. If the square contains a mix of both\nenemy armies and scouts, a battle occurs, but if the losing side in\nthe battle has any scouts in the square, they are killed along with\nthe armies; loot is then collected as normal. Friendly and enemy cities\nA player may move their figures through their own city centers,\nbut they may not end any figure’s movement in their city center. Scouts may enter enemy city outskirts, but they cannot enter\nenemy city centers. Armies may enter enemy city outskirts,\nand may also enter an enemy city center—but this immediately\nresults in an attack on the city. 5.", "RESEARCH\nSimultaneously, each player may learn 1 new tech by spending\ntrade, then add their newly learned tech to their tech pyramid. You must meet the minimum trade cost for the tech and have a\nlegal space in your civilization’s tech pyramid. Then place the\nchosen tech card facedown in your tech pyramid. Once all players have chosen their tech cards for the turn, all\nresearched tech cards are revealed simultaneously. Tech learned\nby a player only applies to that player. You need at least 6 trade to research a level I tech, as indicated\non the dial by the ‘I’ that replaces the number 6. It costs an\nadditional 5 trade for each level thereafter. Researching a tech\nspends all of your remaining trade. However you may retain 1 trade for each coin you possess\n(this never increases your current trade).The tech pyramid\nLevel I tech cards may always be legally placed in your tech\npyramid, forming its bottom row.", "When you learn a level II tech, it must be placed above 2 level I\ntech cards already in your pyramid. Level III tech cards must be\nplaced above 2 level II tech cards in their pyramid, and so on. Tech card abilities\nUnlocking units, buildings, and governments: When you learn\na tech showing a new unit type, building, or government, you\nimmediately unlock the ability to produce that unit or building\nor to change to that government. At the start of the game, all figures, only the 3 basic unit types\n(artillery, infantry, and mounted), and the Despotism government\nare unlocked. Upgrading units: When you learn a tech with a unit upgrade on\nit, check to see if you already know a better upgrade for that unit\ntype. If not, find the military tech marker for the improved unit\ntype and place it below the appropriate unit deck on the market\nboard to show that your units of that type have been upgraded\n(or flip the current marker over if the new rank is on the back).", "Rank 4 is marked with a star. All units of that type that you have already produced are\nimmediately upgraded. Once you have upgraded a unit, you\nmust now pay the higher cost to produce new units of that type. Upgrading buildings: Some buildings have a basic and an\nupgraded form (on the front and back of the same markers). On the market board, upgraded buildings have an arrow next\nto their names. When you learn a tech unlocking an upgraded\nbuilding, immediately flip over any of the corresponding basic\nbuildings that you’ve already produced in your cities. Once you have unlocked the upgraded version of a building, you\ncan no longer produce the basic version, and must now produce\nthe higher-cost building. You do not need to know the tech that unlocks the basic building\nin order to learn the tech that unlocks its upgraded form. Resource abilities: require resource tokens to be spent.", "Each\nhas a picture of the resource or resources required to use it (a\nquestion mark means any resource of your choice); the phase in\nwhich the ability may be used; and the actual ability. Each given resource ability may only be used once per turn,\nregardless of how many resource tokens a player has. If a player\nknows several techs with similar resource abilities, then each\nmay be used once per turn. Other abilities can be granted by tech cards; see the icon key. COINS AND ECONOMIC POWER\nPlayers track their coins on their economy dials. Coins do not\nallow you to keep trade after any event other than researching\na tech. Therefore, your trade can still be reduced below your number\nof coins when spending trade to rush production or when trade\nis taken after the loss of a battle.", "Coins on the map\nCoins gained from squares on the map are only kept as long\nas the player retains control of the square (i.e., the square is\ncontained in the outskirts of one of the player’s cities or one of\nthe player’s scouts remains in the square to gather from it). If an enemy figure blockades the square containing the coin,\n it is lost while the enemy figure remains there. If a building\ngranting a coin to a player is destroyed, the coin is lost. Coin tokens\nCoin tokens placed on a tech card as a reward for accomplishing\na certain task are treated just like coins on the map, except that\nthere is a maximum number of times a given task will provide a\ncoin token.

If you have a scout in the outskirts of an enemy city on top\nof a building or wonder, then you both deny your opponent the\nicons and/or resources in that square, and may also send them\nhome to one of your cities. Consequently, the city benefits from any trade, production, or\nother icons in the square for the turn. BLOCKADES\nA square in a city’s outskirts that contains 1 or more enemy\nfigures (scouts or armies) does not generate production, trade,\nculture, coins, or resources for the city’s owner. A square may be\nblockaded even if it contains a building or a great person.", "While an enemy figure remains in the same square as a wonder’s\nmarker, the special ability on the wonder’s card\ncannot be used and the culture produced by its marker cannot\nbe collected. Buildings, wonders, great people, and scouts cannot be placed\nin a blockaded square after being produced. Army figures may be\nplaced in a blockaded square, but doing so immediately results\nin a battle, with the blockading player as the defender. A scout may gather icons in a blockaded square in the outskirts\nof an enemy city. In this case, the square is considered to be a\npart of the city the scout is sending it to for the turn rather than\nthe city being blockaded. OBSOLETING WONDERS\nCertain techs (Monarchy and Gunpowder) allow a player to\nobsolete a wonder. When a wonder is obsoleted, turn its wonder\ncard facedown, but leave its wonder marker on the map. The\nwonder’s special ability is negated and cannot be used for the\nrest of the game.", "However, the wonder marker still produces\nculture when the city it is in is devoted to the arts. WINNING THE GAME\nCulture victory: As soon as a player advances to the Culture\nVictory space on the market board, they win the game. Tech victory: When a player researches the level 5 Space Flight\ntech, they win the game. The fewest level I tech cards a player\nmust know to reach level V is five (and a minimum of 15 techs\noverall is required for a tech victory). Economic victory: When a player accumulates 15 coins on their\neconomic dial, they win the game. Coins are either gained from\nsquares on the map and building, or from certain techs. Military victory: A player who conquers another player’s capital\ncity wins the game. ADVANCED TIE-BREAKER VARIANT\nOn a military victory, the game ends immediately and that player\nwins. If a player completes a culture, economic, or technology\nvictory, the rest of the turn is played out.", "After the end of the\nturn, every player who has completed a non-military victory\n(remembering that military victories instantly win the game)\ncalculates their victory score, as follows:\nVictory Score = Number of Learned Technologies + Number\nof Spaces Advanced on Culture Track + Number of Coins\nThe player with the highest Victory Score wins the game. In the event that 2 or more players are still tied, they share\nthe victory. TURN SUMMARY\n1. Start of turn\nPass the first player marker clockwise.

Armies may explore huts and villages by moving onto them\n(if they do so, or join battle, their movement ends). Scouts cannot enter huts or villages. A scout that enters a battle\nis immediately killed. If accompanied by an army, a scout is only\nkilled if the army figures die. 5. Research\nSimultaneously, each player may research 1 new tech by paying\nthe tech’s minimum  cost, then adding the tech to a legal spot\nin their tech pyramid.

When a unit attacks or is attacked by a unit that\nit has pictured on its card as a trump symbol, it trumps that unit,\ndealing its damage before the other unit can do so. If this damage\nkills the trumped unit, the trumped unit deals no damage back. Battle abilities: Tech cards with resource abilities used in battle\nare always used before or after attacking an enemy front, never\nduring—even if the effects may last through an attack. Aircraft units: A player who learns the Flight tech may produce\naircraft units; they cannot trump or be trumped by any unit. 4. Resolving the battle\nThe battle is over after both players have played all of their battle\nforces.", "Before wound tokens are removed from surviving units,\neach player adds together the health values of all their surviving\nunits. Then each player subtracts the total number of wounds\non their surviving units, and adds the value of the combat bonus\ncard (if they have it) to determine their final combat value. The player with the highest total wins; ties go to the defender. The winner loses 1 army figure in the square for every 2 of their\nunits that were killed in the battle. A player’s last army figure\nin the square can never be lost this way. All wounds are then\nremoved from surviving units. The winner also receives a reward:\nIf the loser had 1 or more figures in the square:\nThe winner gains 1 loot. If the loser was defending one of their non-capital cities:\nThe winner gains 2 loot. If the loser was defending their capital city:\nThe winner immediately wins the game with a military victory. The winner immediately spends the loot they received to\npurchase effects as follows.", "A winner receiving more than 1 loot\nmay purchase as many effects as they can afford, and they may\npurchase the same effect multiple times. 1 loot effect\n•  Steal up to 3 points of trade from the loser’s trade dial. •  Steal up to 3 culture tokens from the loser. •  Steal any 1 resource token from the loser (facedown hut and\nvillage tokens may be chosen, but the winner does not get to\nsee what they are before choosing). •  Force the loser to discard a coin token of the winner’s choice. This cannot affect investments. 2 loot effects\n•  Learn one of the loser’s known techs that the winner does not\nknow, without having to pay the trade cost. The winner must\nhave a legal spot in their tech pyramid to do so. •  Steal one of the loser’s culture event cards. The winner only\ngets to look at the card backs when choosing. •  Steal one of the loser’s coin tokens and place it on the winner’s\ncivilization sheet. This cannot affect investments.", "Aftermath\nAny surviving units (whether owned by the winner or the loser)\nare returned to their owner’s standing forces. Any killed units are placed faceup on the bottom of their\nrespective unit decks."]
