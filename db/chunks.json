Symptoms: ineffective emotional regulations, unstable interpersonal relationships, distorted self -\nperceptions, and extreme emotions and behaviors concerning self -harm and suicidal attempts. Why I chose this topic:\nI grew up in a similar family environment as someone with BPD, and one of my family members\nsuffers from related mental health issues. There is a growing awareness of the impact of the\nfamily on one's mental health. Learn about possible family -related causes of BPD in\nwomen for prevention.", "Implicit research question:\nDoes t he incidence of borderline personality disorder\n(BPD) in women relate to family factors during\nchildhood? Thesis idea:\nThe incidence of BPD in women is related to five major\nfamily factors during childhood. Keywords of claims:\na)parental neglect\nb)overprotection (excessive control)\nc)rejection of reasonable demands\nd)inconsistent parenting\ne)childhood maltreatment\nClaim #1\nThe incidence of BPD in women is associated\nwith parental neglect manifested as a lack of care\nfrom parents during childhood. Female participants with BPD recruited in Netherlands and Germany\nreported significantly higher childhood parental neglect than the\ncontrol groups (Krause -Utz et al., 2019, p. 6). According to the research of Merza et al. (2015), in which 85% of\nBPD participants were Hungarian women, 86% of BPD participants\nself-reported a childhood history of physical and emotional neglect\nfrom their caregivers (p. 115). Parental neglect is a general family factor related to the BPD in\nwomen in different contexts but not limited to one specific culture.", "Parental neglect\nBPD participants Other\nClaim #2\nThe occurrence of BPD in women is correlated to\noverprotective parents with excessive control\nduring childhood. According to Fletcher et al. (2014), participants represented by women\nwith BPD were more likely to have caregivers with excessive control\nand protection during childhood, and they could be more negatively\naffected by this parenting style than the participants with bipolar II\ndisorder in the control group (p. 57). Bipolar II disorder: a mental illness similarly characterized as suffering\nfrom severe emotional loss of control\nWomen with BPD reported more environmental influences. Japanese female participants with BPD depicted their parents as\nsignificantly overprotective and overcontrolling in their early years,\nwhich could be more common in Japanese culture, especially for\nwomen ( Machizawa -Summers, 2007, p. 271). Therefore, in East Asian countries influenced by Confucian culture,\nyoung girls are more likely to have parents who are authoritarian\ncaregivers, making them vulnerable to BPD. Women with BPD may have an unempathetic\ncaregiver who rejects their reasonable demands\nduring childhood.", "Claim #3\nFemale BPD patients tended to\nexperience denial from parents\nin childhood, and paternal\nrejection without respect for\ntheir needs was an indicator of\nBPD in the future (Laporte &\nGuttman, 2007, p. 136).Parental rejection with punishment in childhood was\nsignificantly correlated with the incidence of BPD in\nwomen, while the emotional warmth from mothers\nwas a protective factor (Huang et al., 2014, p. 43). These findings reveal the importance that both\nparents accept and respect a girl's understandable\nneeds early in life.Paternal MaternalParental Rejection\nClaim #4\nFemale BPD patients may experience confusing\nand disorganized parenting styles during\nchildhood due to their caregivers' inconsistent\nresponses to similar stimuli in daily life. Parents of BPD daughters tended to have inconsistent values and\ndisciplines toward daily routine, which could increase the risk of BPD\n(Boucher et al., 2017, p. 244). Contradictory messages and behavioral conflicts conveyed from parents\nto their children may be triggers for BPD (Allen et al., 2005, pp. 346 -347).", "Inconsistent guidance can be confusing for adults, let alone\ncontradictory instructions from intimate caregivers when a child cannot\nyet distinguish right from wrong. Claim #5\nChildhood maltreatment from their family is\nalso a high -risk factor for BPD in women. The long -term research indicated\nthat abused children were more\nlikely to be diagnosed with BPD\nby age 40, and there was an\nincreased risk of BPD for girls\nwith sexual or physical abuse in\nchildhood experience ( Widom et\nal., 2009, pp. 441 -443). childhood maltreatment\n↓\nBPD in middle ageChildren with experiences of harsh\ntreatment by caregivers, including\nphysical abuse, were more likely to\ndevelop BPD than children with no\nhistory of abuse (Belsky et al.,\n2012, p. 261). Children are vulnerable to child\nabuse within families, and young\ngirls are especially prone to\nfamily -related maltreatment due to\nthe physiological characteristics of\nfemales. Gender -differentiated BPD incidence\nCounterargumentThere is no clear association between the incidence\nof BPD in women and family -related childhood\nmaltreatment.", "Compared with their sisters without BPD, family -related\nchildhood maltreatment history was not necessarily\nrelated to the development of BPD in women but more\nto personality traits (Laporte et al., 2011, pp. 457 -458). Participants: twin or non -twin sisters who grew up in the\nsame family environment\nIndividual personality traits →BPD in women\nRefutation\nThe previous explanation ignores the significant interaction\nbetween childhood maltreatment and other factors such as\npersonality traits. Instead, there is clear evidence that\nfamily -related abuse during childhood negatively impacts\nthe development of BPD in women. Parental child abuse might increase BPD incidence, and\nchildren with BPD -related temperaments could be more\nvulnerable to the interaction of maltreatment experiences\n(Joyce et al., 2003, pp. 758 -759). According to Martí n -Blanco et al. (2014), most female BPD\nparticipants reported a history of child abuse in their families. Specific temperaments, such as the personality traits that\nindividuals tend to show excessive aggression and hostility to\nblame others, could interact with the history of maltreatment\nto create high -risk factors for BPD (pp. 315 -316).", "The interactions with personal traits put some women in danger even though\nthe effects of childhood maltreatment within families do not exist alone. Conclusion\nParental neglect\n Excessive control\n Parental rejection\nChildhood maltreatment\nStrong correlations\n No meaningful correlations\nConfusing parenting styles\nFinal thoughts\nThe purpose of seeking potential family factors associated with BPD in women is not to blame\nparents or find the source of hatred. Instead, the awareness of the relationship between BPD in\nwomen and family factors in their early life is essential to ease the suffering of female patients and\nhelp them form healthy family relationships in the future .
